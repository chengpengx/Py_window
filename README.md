# Py_window
Using pyflex to select effective waveform window of exploration seismic data.
With the increasing number of exploration seismic data and the development of full waveform inversion technology, 
the selection of effective waveform window has become a key research field. 
I use pyflex as the basis to adapt pyflex so that it can be applied to the selection of effective waveform of exploration seismic data.
